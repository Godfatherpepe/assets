    "description": "The first of its kind, $PLUTO ties a narrative to universal basic income (UBI) driven by the community that collaborates on a “choose-your-own-adventure” model of governance to propel Pepe across the galaxy and earn $PLUTO and $PEPE tokens in return. Vote on major network decisions disguised as plot points on Pepe’s adventure to improve the network in a decentralized fashion. With enough $PEPE, Pluto's national currency, you unlock free airdrops, bonus NFPs (Non-Fungible Pepes), and the ability to vote on Pepe's decisions.",
